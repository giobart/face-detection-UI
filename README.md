# face-detection-UI
web UI for [who's that pokemon project](https://github.com/giobart/whos_that_pokemon/tree/develop)
![Example](demo.png)


# Run the service
run the UI with `python entry.py`. This will start the web server at localhost:5006. <br>
In order to upload a new image to the database you must also run the `Ã¬mage-registration-service` on the default 5005 port.  <br><br>
Disclaimer: Don't trust the username & pass login, it is just a demonstrative login with default username "admin" and password "admin". Nothing more than a graphical feature to simulate a system administrator that adds new people to the database.
